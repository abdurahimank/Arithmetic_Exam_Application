# Arithmetic_Exam_Application
An application that can facilitate solving arithmetic operations in a quick manner.

# Sample ideas:

1. Add a complex exam. Increase a difficulty level on the fly. For example, if a person passed the 1st level, start the 2nd one immediately.
2. You can add a correction level: store the tasks with wrong answers and give them next time.
3. Add more difficulty levels.
4. Track the time (read about Timer).
5. Write a more detailed report to a file with the results.
6. Show previous results inside the app (show lines from results.txt that contains the username)
7. Any other improvement that might be useful!
